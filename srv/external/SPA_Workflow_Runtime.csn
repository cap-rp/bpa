By default, the parameter is false. When set to true, the operation is cascaded to its referenced subflow instances.\n\n* Workflow instances in SUSPENDED status stop processing as soon as the system allows.\n\n* Workflow instances remain in SUSPENDED status until a status change to RUNNING or CANCELED is requested.\n\n* While the workflow instance status reported by the respective API might change with immediate effect, follow-up actions might only be successful, after asynchronous processing within the workflow instance actually has stopped. To check whether asynchronous processing is ongoing, analyze the execution logs or check the workflow definition structure.\n\nWhen you are changing the status to RUNNING, note the following:\n\n* For workflow instances in ERRONEOUS status, this retries the failed activities. If these activities continue failing, the workflow instance automatically moves again into ERRONEOUS status.\n\n* If the workflow instance had previously been suspended while in ERRONEOUS status, failed activities, such as service tasks, are retried.\n\n* You can choose to retry or resume the specified instance or the whole cascade by setting boolean parameter \"cascade\".
